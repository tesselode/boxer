Todo:
- [ ] More event callbacks
	- [ ] `onClick` - differs from `onPress` in that it fires as soon as the button is clicked, not just when it's released
	- [ ] `onMove` - maybe useful?
	- [ ] `onDrag`
	- [ ] `onEnter`/`onLeave`
- [ ] Make some properties readonly, like `pressed` and `hovered`
- [ ] More thorough `options` validation
- [ ] Maybe find a more compact way to define properties that can be set to either a function or a value, since this is a common pattern I'm repeating a lot
- [ ] Animation support? Might be out of scope
- [ ] More drawing objects, like circles and polygons
	- Circles could potentially have their own clipping rules
	- May not be worth the effort, as people can define their own draw functions, making drawing shapes fairly trivial
- [ ] Code review
	- [ ] Make sure I'm only using the `get` function when I need to
		- `get` is used frequently to get the values of styles - this can probably be done in the `_getCurrentStyle` function
