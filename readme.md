Boxer
=====

**Boxer** is a library for arranging and drawing shapes in LÃ–VE. It's best used for positioning rectangular objects, such as images and text. It also handles mouse events, making it a good base for UI work.

Installation
------------
To use Boxer, place boxer.lua in your project, and then `require` it in each file where you need to use it:

```lua
local boxer = require 'boxer' -- if your boxer.lua is in the root directory
local boxer = require 'path.to.boxer' -- if it's in subfolders
```

Usage
-----

### Creating boxes

### Positioning boxes

### Mouse events

### Drawing boxes

### Children

### Images

### Text

API
---

### Box

#### Constructors

```lua
local box = boxer.box {
	x/left/center/right: number,
	y/top/middle/bottom: number,
	width: number,
	height: number,
	...
}
```
Creates a new box. Takes an options table to set the properties for the box. Exactly one horizontal position property and one vertical position property must be defined, as well as `width` and `height`. Any other box properties can also be defined to set them immediately on the new box.

```lua
local box = boxer.wrap {children: table, padding: number = 0}
```
Creates a box that contains the specified children and adjusts the children's position to be relative to the new box. Optionally surrounds the children with the specified amount of padding.

#### Functions

```lua
local x = box:getX(offset: number = 0)
```
Gets the x coordinate of an arbitrary point along the x-axis of the box. An offset of `0` gets the left side, `0.5` gets the center, and `1.0` gets the right side.

```lua
local y = box:getY(offset: number = 0)
```
Gets the y coordinate of an arbitrary point along the y-axis of the box. An offset of `0` gets the left side, `0.5` gets the center, and `1.0` gets the right side.

```lua
local x, y, width, height = box:getRect()
```
Gets the position and size of the box. Useful for plugging into `love.graphics` functions, such as `love.graphics.rectangle`.

```lua
local containsPoint = box:containsPoint(x: number, y: number)
```
Returns whether the specified point is within the box's bounds.

```lua
box:setX(x: number, anchorX: number = 0)
```
Sets the x position of a certain point along the x-axis of the box. The anchor will be remembered so that future changes to the width of the box will not change the position of the specified point.

```lua
box:setY(y: number, anchorY: number = 0)
```
Sets the y position of a certain point along the y-axis of the box. The anchor will be remembered so that future changes to the height of the box will not change the position of the specified point.

```lua
box:mousemoved(x: number, y: number, dx: number, dy: number, istouch: boolean)
```
Informs the box about mouse move events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousemoved` callback.

```lua
box:mousepressed(x: number, y: number, button: number, istouch: boolean, presses: number)
```
Informs the box about mouse press events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousepressed` callback.

```lua
box:mousereleased(x: number, y: number, button: number, istouch: boolean, presses: number)
```
Informs the box about mouse release events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousereleased` callback.

```lua
box:draw()
```
Draws the box and its children.
