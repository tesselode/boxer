Boxer
=====

**Boxer** is a library for arranging and drawing shapes in LÃ–VE. It's best used for positioning rectangular objects, such as images and text. It also handles mouse events, making it a good base for UI work.

Installation
------------
To use Boxer, place boxer.lua in your project, and then `require` it in each file where you need to use it:

```lua
local boxer = require 'boxer' -- if your boxer.lua is in the root directory
local boxer = require 'path.to.boxer' -- if it's in subfolders
```

Usage
-----

### Creating boxes

### Positioning boxes

### Mouse events

### Drawing boxes

### Children

### Images

### Text

### Box

#### Constructors

```lua
local box = boxer.box {
	x/left/center/right: number,
	y/top/middle/bottom: number,
	width: number,
	height: number,
	...
}
```
Creates a new box. Takes an options table to set the properties for the box. Exactly one horizontal position property and one vertical position property must be defined, as well as `width` and `height`. Any other box properties can also be defined to set them immediately on the new box.

```lua
local box = boxer.wrap {children: table, padding: number = 0}
```
Creates a box that contains the specified children and adjusts the children's position to be relative to the new box. Optionally surrounds the children with the specified amount of padding.

#### Functions

```lua
local x = box:getX(offset: number = 0)
```
Gets the x coordinate of an arbitrary point along the x-axis of the box. An offset of `0` gets the left side, `0.5` gets the center, and `1.0` gets the right side.

```lua
local y = box:getY(offset: number = 0)
```
Gets the y coordinate of an arbitrary point along the y-axis of the box. An offset of `0` gets the left side, `0.5` gets the center, and `1.0` gets the right side.

```lua
local x, y, width, height = box:getRect()
```
Gets the position and size of the box. Useful for plugging into `love.graphics` functions, such as `love.graphics.rectangle`.

```lua
local containsPoint = box:containsPoint(x: number, y: number)
```
Returns whether the specified point is within the box's bounds.

```lua
box:setX(x: number, anchorX: number = 0)
```
Sets the x position of a certain point along the x-axis of the box. The anchor will be remembered so that future changes to the width of the box will not change the position of the specified point.

```lua
box:setY(y: number, anchorY: number = 0)
```
Sets the y position of a certain point along the y-axis of the box. The anchor will be remembered so that future changes to the height of the box will not change the position of the specified point.

```lua
box:mousemoved(x: number, y: number, dx: number, dy: number, istouch: boolean)
```
Informs the box about mouse move events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousemoved` callback.

```lua
box:mousepressed(x: number, y: number, button: number, istouch: boolean, presses: number)
```
Informs the box about mouse press events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousepressed` callback.

```lua
box:mousereleased(x: number, y: number, button: number, istouch: boolean, presses: number)
```
Informs the box about mouse release events. The arguments correspond to those of the `love.mousereleased` callback.

```lua
box:draw()
```
Draws the box (if a style is set) and its children.

#### Callbacks

```lua
function box.onPress(button: number) ... end
```
Called when the box is clicked and released. Useful for creating buttons.

```lua
function box.onClick(button: number) ... end
```
Called as soon as the box is clicked.

```lua
function box.onEnter() ... end
```
Called when the mouse comes within bounds of the box.

```lua
function box.onLeave() ... end
```
Called when the mouse leaves the bounds of the box.

```lua
function box.onMove(relativeX: number, relativeY: number, displacementX: number, displacementY: number)
```
Called when the mouse is moved over the box. The arguments are the position of the mouse relative to the top-left corner of the box, and the amount the mouse was moved, respectively.

```lua
function box.onMove(button: number, displacementX: number, displacementY: number)
```
Called when the box is clicked and dragged.

#### Properties
- `name` (`string`) - the name of the box.
- `style` (`table`) - the styles the box should use.
- `children` (`table`) - a list of the objects contained within this box. Children at a higher index in the table are considered to be "above" those with a lower index. If a child has a `name` property, you can also access it via `children[name]`.
- `clipChildren` (`boolean` | `function -> boolean`) - whether portions of the children outside of the box's bounds should be hidden and unclickable.
- `transparent` (`boolean` | `function -> boolean`) - whether the box should allow mouse events to pass through to lower children in the same parent box.
- `hidden` (`boolean`) - whether the box should be invisible.
- `disabled` (`boolean`) - whether the box should ignore mouse events.
- `hovered` (`boolean`) (readonly) - whether the mouse is currently over the box.
- `pressed` (`false | number`) (readonly) - the number of the mouse button the box is currently being held down by, or `false` if it is not being held down.

### Text
(inherits from Box)

#### Constructors

```lua
local text = boxer.text {
	x/left/center/right: number,
	y/top/middle/bottom: number,
	text: string,
	font: Font,
	...
}
```
Creates a new text object. Position, text, and font properties are required, but any box or text properties can be included in the options table. Unlike the `Box` constructor, `width` and `height` are optional.

#### Properties
- `text` (`string` | `function -> string`) - the text content to draw.
- `font` (`Font` | `function -> Font`) - the font to use for drawing. Fonts can be created using `love.graphics.newFont`.
- `scaleX` (`number` | `function -> number`) - the horizontal scaling factor of the text. Changing this will affect the `width` of the text.
- `scaleY` (`number` | `function -> number`) - the vertical scaling factor of the text. Changing this will affect the `height` of the text.
- `width` (`number`) - the total width of the text. Changing this will affect the `scaleX` of the text.
- `height` (`number`) - the total height of the text. Changing this will affect the `scaleY` of the text.

### Paragraph
(inherits from Box)

#### Constructors

```lua
local paragraph = boxer.paragraph {
	x/left/center/right: number,
	y/top/middle/bottom: number,
	width: number,
	text: string,
	font: Font,
	...
}
```
Creates a new paragraph object. Works similarly to the Text object, but the text is automatically split into lines depending on the `width` of the object.

#### Properties
- `text` (`string` | `function -> string`) - the text content to draw.
- `font` (`Font` | `function -> Font`) - the font to use for drawing. Fonts can be created using `love.graphics.newFont`.
- `align` (`string` | `function -> string`) - the alignment mode of the text. Can be `'left'`, `'center'`, `'right'`, or `'justify'`.
- `width` (`number`) - the width that a line of text is allowed to span.
- `height` (`number`) (readonly) - the total height of the paragraph. Unlike the Text object, this cannot be changed, as it is a product of the width of the box and the amount/size of text.

### Image
(inherits from Box)

#### Constructors

```lua
local image = boxer.image {
	x/left/center/right: number,
	y/top/middle/bottom: number,
	image: Image,
	...
}
```
Creates a new image object. Position and image properties are required, but any box or image properties can be included in the options table. Unlike the `Box` constructor, `width` and `height` are optional.

#### Properties
- `image` (`Image` | `function -> Image`) - the image to draw.
- `scaleX` (`number` | `function -> number`) - the horizontal scaling factor of the image. Changing this will affect the `width` of the image.
- `scaleY` (`number` | `function -> number`) - the vertical scaling factor of the image. Changing this will affect the `height` of the image.
- `width` (`number`) - the total width of the image. Changing this will affect the `scaleX` of the image.
- `height` (`number`) - the total height of the image. Changing this will affect the `scaleY` of the image.
